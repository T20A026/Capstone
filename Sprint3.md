# Sprint 3

## Statement

Sprint 3 is the 3rd and final sprint for this project. In this final sprint, I will begin an finalize my instructables artical, as well as wrapping up and cleanign up my references and sources. Additonally I will try to continue working towards passing data collection, but as I have been having trouble with getting a reliable source of canbus header information, such as their accual uses and values, I may not have the time to complete this before the given deadline, and also have other diliverables ready

## Breakdown

* Continue attempting to get a good decode list running, for the GMLAN netwokring
* Prove they are exploites and elaborate, as well as complie a report of any findings on protection/durability mechanisims wich prevented easy exploit. 
* Create a Instructables artical outline building my tool, and using it on multiple vehicals, as well as a conprensive outline of how to build this for beginners.

## Reflections

### Week 11 Reflection
This week I continued to work on the passive collection of data, and decoding the headers for use in some simple ptograms. I have yet to find a strong souce for the engine messages, and I am planning on attempting a 1 wire CAN capture using a different can hat I got in the mail. Additonally I have begun cleaning and compiling my sources, as well as thinking about how I am going to layout my class presentation, including highs and lows. 

### Week 12 Reflection
I am still waiting for the car back from the shop, after a frusturating 2 weeks of waiting for custome fittings and parts coming in. I will have the car back tommorow or Tuesday according to the shop, and then I can run my tests for one wire CAN connections to the I Bus, and further workings with that. In the mean time I have spent some additonal time reading and researching about some of the constrints and possible issues with the 1 wire CAN connection, as well as I have begun writing and parsing the Instructables Artical, for building my "Car Hacking" tool including deciding what sections I will have and the layout. After this is done, I will have it reviewed by a few peer's to see how easily followed it is from a zero Knowlage individual of both technical and non-technical backgrounds.
