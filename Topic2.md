## Proposal 2:
> Container and Microservices Security Analysis: Investigate and enhance the security of containerized applications and microservices architectures. Explore vulnerabilities unique to these environments and propose solutions.

This project is a bit more out of my comfort zone, but I have worked with, and around containerised networks before, and I find them very useful and efficient, but also harder to secure as opposed to a stand alone VM. I Hope to learn more about the Security side of engineering projects.

** This Project would involve all aspects of network security, but will focus on containerized systems and services.**

### Milestones: 
* Container Hardening, and Image choice

* Generating Secure Templates for containers

* Isolating containers from each other and the host

* Host OS Security

* Policies and controls for what can and cannot be used, and what is acceptable and unnecessary

* Implement logging and investigation techniques on the containers

* Auditing guidelines and compliance checks
