### Proposal 1:
> **Secure IoT Network Infrastructure:** Design and build a secure network infrastructure for IoT devices. Focus on securing communication between IoT devices and the cloud, implementing security protocols, and monitoring for unusual behavior.

I Like this project because I feel it will become an increasingly more important focus in infrastructure in the future with more and more systems becoming IoT, such as door access controls, and monitoring tools. IoT is a massive consumer market as well and these devices will make their way into enterprise networks, whether it be a work or school environment. 


**This Project would involve all aspects of network security, but will focus on IoT devices themselves.**
### Milestones:

* Authentication onto the network and initial access control
* Securing and compartmentalizing services that do not need to be available to these devices
* Assessing their use case, and mitigating unnecessary use cases, and therefore possible openings
* Monitoring and logging unusual traffic, to unknown targets
* Implementing a strong control and access policy for the devices, for continued security
