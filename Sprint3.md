# Sprint 3

## Statement

Sprint 3 is the 3rd anf final sprint for this project. After learning and logging the activity on the can netowork, we will have a glimps into the data being moved, as well as what modules are reponsible for certain actions, and where certain data and functions are sotred. With this we will be able to take these notes, and look for possible vulnrebilities, and from this find out what could be controlled, remotley, and what data can be collected from the car. From this we will be bale to create a threat report for the specific car, and for any strange, or dangerous command sor controls we have access to.  

## Breakdown

* Find any modules of interest, that control important fucntiosn, that could be leveraged for data collection, or control
* Prove they are exploitable if they are, and document the attack, as well as its repeatability
* Create a professional threat report, if concerning attacks are possible
