# Sprint 2 

## Statement

Sprint 2 Will start once connections are estabished, and basic collection fo data, and logging is achieved, and data formatting is gathered. Here I will beggin logging data, and creating test events to corrolate, and cross reference to internet resources, to gain and understanfing of the hearers and identities of differen modules in the car. With this data I can parse outputs from logs, and provide live output data logging, in a easy to read human form to the CLI, and if sucessful, create a simpel User Interface for the system. Once That is achived I will have an udnerstanding of the unique headers used in the cars can network, and I can attempt to spoof modules in the car, activley querying data instead of passivly collecting it, allowing changes to be made to the system.

## Breakdown

* Log data and create chart of known headers, sucspected headers, and unknown headers
* Use passive data collection for readouts, and controls to systems not part of the cars origonal systems
* Use the collected data, and communications, to provide live chanegs to systems like infotainment and others.
