# Sprint 1 

## Statement

Sprint 1 Will be the initail configuartion and settup for the canbus controller, and the hareware configuration. This will also involved weather I am proceeding with the Aurduino + Sparkfun Hat, or the Raspberry Pi 4 + RS485 Controler Board. I am curious to see how debian on the RPi treats the canbsu interface, and if standard networking tools can be used with it.
